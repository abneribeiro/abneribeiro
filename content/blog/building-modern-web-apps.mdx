# Building Modern Web Applications

The landscape of web development has evolved significantly over the past few years. As developers, we now have access to powerful tools and frameworks that enable us to build sophisticated applications with better performance and developer experience.

## The Stack I Choose

When starting a new project, I typically reach for a combination of technologies that have proven to work well together:

- **Next.js** for the React framework with built-in optimizations
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling and consistent design systems
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions

## Performance First

Performance isn't just about making things fast - it's about creating experiences that users love. Here are some key principles I follow:

- **Code splitting** to load only what's needed
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
- **Static generation** where possible
- **Proper caching strategies**

## Developer Experience Matters

A good developer experience leads to better code and faster iteration. Some tools that enhance DX:

- **Hot reloading** for instant feedback
- **TypeScript** for catching errors early
- **ESLint and Prettier** for consistent code quality
- **Git hooks** for automated checks

The goal is to create applications that are not just functional, but delightful to use and maintain.

## Looking Forward

The web platform continues to evolve, and I'm excited about upcoming features like:

- **React Server Components** for better performance
- **Streaming SSR** for faster page loads
- **Edge computing** for global performance
- **Progressive enhancement** for better accessibility

Building for the web has never been more exciting, and I look forward to seeing what we can create together!


```javascript
function somar(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(somar(3, 4)); // 7
